/* I thought the game was good happy medium, the chaos balls and collisions added some difficulty but it was overall fun. */

/* Slowing the balls down  would make it easier, and 
 * adding obsticles such as other blocks that the balls could bounce off of would make it more difficult */

/* Giving the goals a little sound when they are destoryed like when you win big at the casion, would be excitng */

/* I liked the interactions of the different balls it was very choatic and had me feeling like a kid playing a silly game.
 * Getting the balls to the goals I thought were a tedious task since all the balls are knocking into each other and possibly the camera view */
